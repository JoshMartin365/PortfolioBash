# PortfolioBash
A little bash script to get to know me a little more! This was a project assigned to us interns at 365 Retail Markets for the summer internship. The point of this excersize is to practice our bash scriptting, showcasing variable usages, conditional operators and so forth. I have never programmed a bash script before so here goes nothing!

# To run bash script:
1. Download the file in your chosen directory
2. In the terminal enter protfolio_bash_script.sh or ./portfolio_bash_script.sh

# How it should function:
1. Roll a 1d20 to get a random fact
2. Ask the user if they are done rolling.
3. If so display contact information
4. End the Program
